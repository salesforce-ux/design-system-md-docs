## Overview of CSS Classes

| __What are these categories?__ |   |
|---|---|
| Selector | The CSS class being referred to. |
| Summary | A description of what the class does. |
| Support | Whether the class name is dev-ready (meaning it's fully vetted and tested and safe to use) or prototype (which means it's not fully vetted yet). |
| Restrict | The selector that the class name is allowed to be used on. |
| Variant | The base level pattern for a component. A variant can be extended to create another variant of that component, for example, a stateful button is a derivative of the base button. |
| Modifier | A single class that can be added to an HTML element of a component to modify its output. Typically these will be colors, sizing and positioning. |
