## Introduction

A builder is a tool that lets everyone from developers and admins to business users create and customize applications and business processes. Developers and admins use builders such as Lightning App Builder, Experience Builder, Bot Builder, and Flow Builder to create interfaces for business users. Users can also create experiences for teams or customers with tools such as Journey Builder and Engagement Studio.

There are four main types of builder:

*   **Logic builders** visualize business processes, flows, or sequences.
*   **Content builders** are used to design and configure web pages and other visual elements.
*   **Data builders** help users develop reports and presentations featuring tables, charts, and graphs.
*   **Code builders** are used to develop code views and database schemas.

## Usage

When should you think about using a builder? Start, as always, with the user. If users will be doing one or more of these things, there could be a builder in your future:

*   Working with WYSIWYG (“what you see is what you get”) declarative elements that can be added with clicks and customized with forms
*   Designing a business process on a blank canvas
*   Creating and defining a series of logical actions that result in different outputs
*   Defining the relationship of one element to another—for example, in a workflow or visual layout
*   Saving and tracking multiple drafts or versions
